Bhagwan Shiva’s rest lasting one prahar of the night, is called Mahashivratri

In certain parts of India it is celebrated on Falgun Krushna Chaturdashi (Vikram Samvat)

The time flies in the realm of Deities. So Bhagwan Shiva’s daily resting period comes once a year on Earth

Importance of Mahashivratri

On the day of Mahashivratri, Shiva-tattva (Deity Shiva’s Principle) is a thousand times more active in the atmosphere as compared to the other days. To avail maximum spiritual benefit of the Shiva-tattva on this day, chant ।। Om Namah Shivay ।। and worship Deity Shiva with bhav (spiritual emotion). By obtaining more Shiva-tattva, we are protected from negative energies.
