# 02 Persona Chat Frontend

**Live Demo:** [https://02persona-chat-f.vercel.app/](https://02persona-chat-f.vercel.app/)

It lets you chat with AI personas that respond in unique styles. Behind the scenes, your queries are rewritten to help the AI give more accurate and helpful answers. Think of it as having a conversation with an AI that actually understands the context of what you’re asking.

## What You Can Do

- Chat with **AI personas**, each with their own tone and personality.
- Get smarter responses because of automatic query rewriting.
- Have context-aware conversations that remember the flow, making interactions feel natural.
